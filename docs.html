    <h1>Documentation</h1>
    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Panacea will help you to start working directly in the business logic of your app. Removing the pain of integrating some of the most common gems by asking you if you want to do so.</p>
      <p>What usually takes at least 2 hours of your work day, you can get it achieved in less than 2 minutes.</p>
      <p>Panacea uses Rails Templates and Thor actions to do it’s magic.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Panacea support most of the Rails arguments, feel free to use them to tweak how your Rails app is generated.</p>
      <p>You can see the complete list of accepted arguments with the following command:</p>
      <code>$ panacea --help</code>
      <p>The most important argument is the database to use. Panacea works without it, but it assume that the default will be postgresql.</p>
      <code>$ panacea my-app</code>
      <p>The previous command will create a Rails app that uses Postgres as its database.</p>
      <p>Be aware that if you want to use a different database, you should pass the Rails argument to do so:</p>
      <code>$ panacea my-app --database=mysql</code>
